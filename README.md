## 🏢 Branch Service and Audit Report Automation - CHSO & RHSO 🚀

###  Automating Branch Compliance & Service Reporting 📊 - Saving **90%** of Manual Effort!

This project automated the time-consuming and labor-intensive process of generating Branch Service and Audit reports for Cluster Head Service Operations (CHSOs) and Regional Head Service Operations (RHSOs) at YES Bank. The solution saves **90% of the manual time** previously spent on report generation, significantly reduces manual errors, and ensures accurate, timely data for informed decision-making.

### 🎯 Requirement: Manual, Time-Intensive, and Error-Prone Report Generation

The existing process was inefficient and presented several challenges:

*   **😓 Manual Report Download:** CHSOs and RHSOs had to manually download **67 different reports** from the K-Scope system for each branch.
*   **⏱️ Time-Consuming Process:** Each report download and verification took **30-60 minutes per branch**, making it extremely time-consuming, especially as CHSOs are responsible for multiple branches.
*   **🤯 Labor-Intensive:**  Generating reports for just **3 branches per month** could consume approximately **3 hours of manual work** per CHSO/RHSO.
*   **⚠️ Risk of Manual Errors:** Manual report generation increased the risk of human errors and inconsistencies, impacting data reliability.
*   **📉 Inefficient Resource Allocation:**  Valuable time was spent on repetitive report generation instead of strategic initiatives.

### 🤖 Automation Approach:  Streamlined, Scheduled, and User-Friendly Solution

Our automation strategy focused on creating a robust and efficient solution:

*   **🔄 Automated Report Extraction from K-Scope Database:** 🤖 Bot directly connects to the **K-Scope database** and executes **SQL queries** to automatically generate all **67 reports**, eliminating manual download.
*   **💾 Data Storage in Shared Drive:** 🤖 Bot automatically saves the generated reports as individual workbooks with **67 worksheets in a single Excel file** to a designated business shared drive location.
*   **📅 Scheduled & Manual Execution Options:** 🤖 Bot is scheduled to run automatically at **6 AM on the 7th of every month**.  Additionally, a **manual execution option** is provided via the RPA portal for on-demand report generation, offering flexibility and contingency.
*   **🎛️ Configurable Scheduling:** 🤖 Scheduled run time is **configurable**, allowing end-users to request adjustments through the BAU team, ensuring adaptability to changing business needs.
*   **📅 Date Range Parameterization:** 🤖  Users can define a **custom date range (From Date & To Date)** for report generation when running the bot manually, providing control over data extraction periods.
*   **📂 Organized Output Structure:** 🤖 Output files are saved in a well-organized folder structure within the shared drive, **date-time stamped**, and named according to **report code, report name, and zone** (for zone-wise reports), ensuring easy identification and retrieval.
*   **📊 Zone-Wise Report Splitting:** 🤖 For large reports exceeding **6 Lacs records**, the bot intelligently splits the output **zone-wise** into multiple workbooks, improving performance and manageability.
*   **📝 Audit Logging:** 🤖 Comprehensive **audit logs** are captured in the RPA database for every bot execution (scheduled and manual), ensuring traceability and accountability.
*   **📧 Email Notifications:** 🤖 Automated **email notifications** are triggered to relevant stakeholders upon successful or failed bot executions, providing timely updates and facilitating proactive issue resolution.

### ✨ Role of Automation:  Transforming Report Generation from Hours to Minutes

Automation played a transformative role in streamlining branch service and audit reporting:

*   **90% Time Savings:** ⏱️ Automation reduces report generation time by an estimated **90%**, freeing up significant man-hours for CHSOs and RHSOs to focus on strategic tasks.  Manual process took **30-60 minutes per report per branch**, now automated execution takes only **minutes**.
*   **Error Elimination:** 💯 Automated data extraction and processing eliminate manual errors, ensuring **accurate and reliable reports** for decision-making.
*   **Scheduled & On-Demand Reporting:** 📅 Provides both **scheduled and manual execution options**, offering flexibility and ensuring timely report availability.
*   **Centralized Data Delivery:** 📂 Reports are automatically saved to a **shared drive location**, providing easy access and centralized data repository.
*   **Improved Efficiency & Productivity:** 🚀 Automation significantly improves the efficiency of report generation, allowing CHSOs and RHSOs to be more productive and focus on value-added activities.

### 🚀 Benefits Achieved:  Significant Efficiency Gains, Accuracy, and Resource Optimization

The implementation of RPA for branch service and audit report generation delivered substantial benefits:

*   **⏱️ Massive Time Savings (90% Reduction):**  CHSOs and RHSOs save approximately **90% of their time** previously spent on manual report generation, reclaiming valuable work hours.
*   **✅ Enhanced Accuracy & Data Reliability:**  Automated report generation eliminates manual errors, ensuring **highly accurate and reliable data** for branch performance analysis and compliance monitoring.
*   **🎯 Improved Decision-Making:**  Access to timely and accurate reports empowers informed decision-making at both operational and strategic levels, leading to better branch performance and compliance outcomes.
*   **🚀 Increased Operational Efficiency:**  Automation streamlines the entire report generation process, significantly improving overall operational efficiency within branch service operations.
*   **💰 Resource Optimization:**  Freed up man-hours can be redirected to more strategic initiatives, optimizing resource allocation and improving overall team productivity.
*   **📅 Timely Reporting & Compliance:** Scheduled report generation ensures reports are available promptly, supporting timely branch audits and compliance checks.
